	SKILL LEVEL

	YIELD
	2 dozen 3-inch cookies

	INGREDIENTS
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups minus 2 tablespoons cake flour</li>
		<li>1 2/3 cups bread flour</li>
		<li>1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda</li>
		<li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
		<li>1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt</li>
		<li>2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter</li>
		<li>1 1/4 cups light brown sugar</li>
		<li>1 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
		<li>2 large eggs</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons natural vanilla extract</li>
		<li>1 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
		<li>1 cup milk chocolate chips</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
    </ul>

	INSTRUCTIONS

		Sift cake flour, bread flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl. Set aside.

		Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl until very light, about 5 minutes.

		Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.

		Beat in the vanilla.

		Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds.

		Drop chocolate chips in and incorporate them without breaking them.

		Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours. Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours.

		When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and scoop 1/3 cup mounds of dough (the size of golf balls) onto baking sheet, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that are poking up for a more attractive cookie.

		Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake until golden brown but still soft, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer immediately to a wire rack.

		Repeat with remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining batches the next day.

		Eat warm, with a glass of milk.

	EXPERT TIPS

	The secret to richer Chocolate Chip Cookies with a more sophisticated flavor is letting the dough rest for 24 to 36 hours before baking.
