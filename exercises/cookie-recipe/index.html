	<h3>SKILL LEVEL</h3>

	<h3>YIELD</h3>
	2 dozen 3-inch cookies

	<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups minus 2 tablespoons cake flour</li>
		<li>1 2/3 cups bread flour</li>
		<li>1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda</li>
		<li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
		<li>1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt</li>
		<li>2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter</li>
		<li>1 1/4 cups light brown sugar</li>
		<li>1 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
		<li>2 large eggs</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons natural vanilla extract</li>
		<li>1 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
		<li>1 cup milk chocolate chips</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
    </ul>

	<h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

		 <p><ol>1. Sift cake flour, bread flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl. Set aside.<br>

		2. Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl until very light, about 5 minutes.<br>

		3. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.<br>

		4. Beat in the vanilla.<br>

		5. Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds.<br>

		6. Drop chocolate chips in and incorporate them without breaking them.<br>

		7. Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours. Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours.<br>

		8. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and scoop 1/3 cup mounds of dough (the size of golf balls) onto baking sheet, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that are poking up for a more attractive cookie.<br>

		9. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake until golden brown but still soft, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer immediately to a wire rack.<br>

		10. Repeat with remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining batches the next day.<br>

		11. Eat warm, with a glass of milk.</ol></p>

	<h2>EXPERT TIPS</h2>
